- [Resize image](#resize_image)

## Resize image
<span id="resize_image"></span>
Resize image to xxhdpi xhdpi hdpi mdpi.

The original image is designed in ndp * 18 px. For example:
an icon(48dp * 48dp) will be designed in 864px * 864px.
Then the script will generate images in xxhdpi
xhdpi hdpi and mdpi.

resize_img_ratio6.py is similar, but the original image is
designed in ndp * 6 px.
